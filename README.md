# Kazyshop

Kazyshop is the best place to find the most wanted clothes from the latest fashion trends. 

This is a project with the principle of mostly practicing my skills of API and UI building. Keep in mind that everything is far from being complete.

Client is being made with VueJS and React Query and server is using HonoJS as the framework and a self-hosted PostgreSQL database.

Might migrate everything to Nuxt at some point when I feel that I got the results I wanted from the project.
